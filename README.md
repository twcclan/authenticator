# authenticator
QMM plugin for W:ET to handle player authentication

# status
I actually planned to tweak the code slightly before releasing it, but then never got around to doing it. That is why this is a very rough initial version that will be reworked over time to have better source code quality and more solid features.

# license
I am not really into the legal aspects of software licenses, so I settled with GPL for now, but will probably change it later on.
